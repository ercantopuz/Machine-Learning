COVID-19 Blockchain Framework: Innovative Approach
The world is currently witnessing dangerous shifts in the epidemic of emerging SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of (COVID-19) coronavirus. The infection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion. This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System. This four components work together for detecting the unknown infected cases and predicting and estimating the infection Risk of Corona Virus (COVID-19).
