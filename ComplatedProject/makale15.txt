Drugs and the renin-angiotensin system in covid-19
Covid-19, which is caused by the single stranded RNA coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, poses therapeutic dilemmas. Some suggestions for drug treatment seem problematic.1 They include various antiviral drugs, some of which have primary targets that are DNA viruses not RNA; immunomodulatory drugs, which may suppress potentially protective acute inflammatory responses and do not specifically target the virus; the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have some antiviral activity in vitro but no evidence of clinical benefit in human viral infections and also have many adverse effects; and corticosteroids, which may be harmful when used to treat infection with the related virus SARS-CoV-1.2 Important questions have also been raised about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Do they have a role in treating covid-19? Should people currently taking them continue doing so, and should they stop if they become infected? No trial evidence is yet available on the effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in treating covid-19. But for people already taking these drugs the European Society of Cardiology recommends “that physicians and patients should continue treatment … because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued because of the covid-19 infection.” 3 The American College of Cardiology advises that patients should continue taking them for conditions such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischaemic heart disease, and that if covid-19 occurs “individualized treatment decisions should be made according to each patient’s hemodynamic status and clinical presentation.” 4 Little attention has been paid to the balance of benefits and harms associated with using these drugs, and whether this balance differs among individuals. However, their pharmacology and the biology of the virus offer important insights.
